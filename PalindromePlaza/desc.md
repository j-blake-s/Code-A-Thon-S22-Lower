Given a square character matrix, count how many columns, rows, and diagonals can possibly make a palindrome.

Note that we are not counting the number of palindromes, just if they can be made into one.

Note: we consider a single character as a palindrome.


Ex:


a b a
d c d
a b a

Returns 9, 3 rows, 3 cols, 3 diagonals.

in order:

(aba),(dcd),(aba),
(ada),(bcb),(ada),
(a),(aca),(a)
