# Spring 2022 Code-A-Thon Lower Division

Hello all! Welcome to the Spring 2022 Lower Division Repo. Head over to the leaderboards folder to check out the rankings for the top 3 in both 145 and 146. 

From there, you can head over to the Challenges folder to look at all the problems we had this semester. There should be a solution for each problem already made as
well as a way to generate the test cases used in the contest. Look for the sol.(py/cpp/java) in each folder which should be the working solution. Also look for a 
gen.py or mkin.py which should be the generators for the test cases. If they aren't labeled as such you might just have to look for them.


If you want to look at the problems, here is the Alumni Division Contest link: https://www.hackerrank.com/acmusc-codeathon-spring-2022-alumni
