Rosa's Code

You are a Security Consultant contracted by NotInc. Your boss, Rosa, has sent you the password to the firewall.
To protect against corporate espionage, the password is hidden in a text file.

The text file is constructed as follows:
The first line is a number, N. 

A N x N matrix of integers follows (N integers per line).
The top left corner, bottom right corner, and all numbers along the diagonal
are 1. The rest of the numbers increase by one as they move away from the
diagonal.

N integers from the grid have been replaced with 0. Only one integer is 0 in
each row and only one integer is zero in each column.

Find each integer that has been replaced with and print them on a single line,
organized from leftmost to rightmost.

Constraints: 4 < N < 2500
